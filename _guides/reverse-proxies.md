title: Configure a reverse proxy for The Lounge
description: Serve The Lounge through a reverse proxy such as Nginx, Apache, Caddy, HAProxy, Cloudflare, or Redbird
---

{% include toc.md %}

Serving The Lounge through a reverse proxy instead of the built-in HTTP server comes with a few benefits:

- The Lounge needs to run as root in order to serve it on port 80 (or 443 for HTTPS), or you must always type the port number as part of the URL. Reverse proxies usually abstract this, take control of ports 80 and 443, then redirect traffic to The Lounge.

- If the built-in HTTP server is already listening to port 80 or 443, it means that your server cannot serve any other project through these ports. Reverse proxies act as "gates" that route traffic from ports 80 and 443 to the requested service.

- While The Lounge comes with HTTPS support out of the box, any changes to the HTTPS certificates (such as renewing them) requires a server restart. Using a reverse proxy lets you reload the reverse proxy without having to restart The Lounge.

- When serving a website with HTTPS, it is common to also serve an HTTP counterpart that redirects to the HTTPS version. This is not possible with the built-in server that listens to a single port. It is usually trivial to do so with reverse proxies.

It however requires more configuration than just relying on the built-in server, so this guide helps going through the extra complexity.

When using The Lounge behind a reverse proxy, set the `reverseProxy` option to `true` in your configuration file. This will instruct The Lounge to use the `X-Forwarded-For` header passed by your reverse proxy.

This document assumes that your The Lounge is available on host `127.0.0.1` and port `9000`.

## [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/)

```nginx
location / {
	proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9000/;
	proxy_http_version 1.1;
	proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
	proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
	proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
	proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

	# by default nginx times out connections in one minute
	proxy_read_timeout 1d;
}
```

If you want to access The Lounge in a sub folder, change the first line to `location ^~ /irc/ {`

### Compression

If you do not have GZIP compression already configured in Nginx, you may add this configuration to compress proxied files:

```nginx
gzip on;
gzip_vary on;
gzip_proxied any;
gzip_comp_level 5;
gzip_min_length 1000;
gzip_types application/javascript image/svg+xml text/css text/plain;
```

### File uploads

If you have [file uploads](/docs/configuration#fileupload) enabled in The Lounge, you may hit an issue when going over nginx's default upload limit, which will result in a 413 (Request Entity Too Large) error. To prevent this from happening, disable or increase [client_max_body_size](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size) variable.

If you have set [`baseUrl`](/docs/configuration#fileupload) option, then you will need to add extra configuration to proxy the upload urls.

If you set the `baseURL` to `https://example.com/folder/` then you need to add `location /folder/` to your nginx configuration:

```nginx
location /folder/ {
	proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9000/uploads/;
	proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
}
```

## [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/)

Enable the necessary modules `a2enmod rewrite`, `a2enmod proxy`, `a2enmod proxy_http`, and `a2enmod proxy_wstunnel`.

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}  ^/socket.io            [NC]
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} transport=websocket    [NC]
RewriteRule /(.*)           ws://127.0.0.1:9000/$1 [P,L]

ProxyVia On
ProxyRequests Off
ProxyAddHeaders On
ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:9000/
ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:9000/

# By default Apache times out connections after one minute
ProxyTimeout 86400 # 1 day
```

If you want to access The Lounge in a sub folder, use the following configuration:

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^/irc$ /irc/ [R]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}  ^/irc/socket.io        [NC]
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} transport=websocket    [NC]
RewriteRule /irc/(.*)       ws://127.0.0.1:9000/$1 [P,L]

ProxyVia On
ProxyRequests Off
ProxyAddHeaders On
ProxyPass /irc/ http://127.0.0.1:9000/
ProxyPassReverse /irc/ http://127.0.0.1:9000/

# By default Apache times out connections after one minute
ProxyTimeout 86400 # 1 day
```

## [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)

```
proxy / http://127.0.0.1:9000 {
	transparent
	websocket
}
```

### File uploads

If you have set [`baseUrl`](/docs/configuration#fileupload) option, then you will need to add extra configuration to proxy the upload urls.

```
proxy /folder/ http://127.0.0.1:9000/uploads {
	without /folder
	transparent
}
```

## [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/)

```
frontend  main
	bind *:1000
	option forwardfor
	http-request set-header X-Forwarded-Proto https if { ssl_fc }
	acl thelounge_site   hdr(host)  thelounge.example.com
	use_backend thelounge       if thelounge_site

backend thelounge
	server thelounge 127.0.0.1:9000
```

## [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)

The following [page rules](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/218411427) need to be set in order to use the Cloudflare DNS with The Lounge:

- `Rocket Loader` set to `Off`
- `Disable Apps`

Whenever you update The Lounge, you will have to [purge cache in your Cloudflare dashboard](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200169246-Purging-cached-resources-from-Cloudflare) for your browser to correctly receive updated files.

## [Redbird](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redbird) with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)

First, install Redbird:

```
yarn add redbird
```

Then, create a file named `proxy.js` and edit it with:

```js
const redbird = require("redbird")({
	port: 80, // Port to listen HTTP connections
	letsencrypt: {
		path: __dirname + "/certs/", // Certificates will be saved, updated and archived there
	},
	ssl: {
		port: 443, // Port to listen HTTPS connections
	},
});

redbird.register("example.com", "http://127.0.0.1:9000", {
	ssl: {
		letsencrypt: {
			email: "mail@example.com", // Must be a host with MX record
			production: true, // WARNING: Only use this flag when the proxy is verified to work correctly to avoid being banned!
		}
	}
});
```

You can then run it with `node proxy.js`.
