## Debian and Ubuntu based distributions

First, make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v6.13.0 or more recent is installed
with `node --version`. If not, follow the instructions given on the
[official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions).

Then download `thelounge.deb` located at the bottom of
[the latest release](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/releases/latest).

Finally, open a terminal and install the downloaded package using:

```sh
sudo dpkg --install thelounge.deb
```

{: .alert.alert-info role="alert"}
If you don't have root access, you'll need to [run an npm release](#from-npm-releases). Yarn installs global binaries to your user directory by default, which doesn't require root.

This also sets up a `systemd` service, enabled during the install, that you can
control with `systemctl status|start|restart|stop|...`.

The Lounge is now up and running **in private mode** at <http://localhost:9000>.

Its configuration file is located at `/etc/thelounge/config.js`. To configure
The Lounge, go to [the configuration section](/docs/configuration.html).

To upgrade The Lounge, simply follow these steps again after downloading a new
`thelounge.deb` file, and restart the service.

You might want to serve The Lounge behind a reverse proxy such as Nginx. To know
more about the benefits and steps, follow
[the guide on reverse proxies ](/docs/guides/reverse-proxies.html).

## Arch Linux

The Lounge is [available in the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/thelounge/).

Please follow the
[Arch Linux documentation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository)
to install this package from the AUR. For example, to install it using an AUR
helper:

```sh
pacaur -aS thelounge
yaourt -aS thelounge
```

Then enable and start the `thelounge.service` unit using:

```sh
systemctl enable --now thelounge.service
```

The Lounge is now up and running **in private mode** at <http://localhost:9000>.

The package provides both a system and a user service to allow you to run The
Lounge as your liking. Simply build and install the AUR package, and start the
service:

- **[System](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd):**
  `systemctl start thelounge.service`. The configuration is stored in
  `/etc/thelounge/config.js`and runs as `thelounge` user.
- **[User](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd/User):**
  `systemctl --user start thelounge.service`. The configuration is stored in
  your home directory in `~/.thelounge/config.js`.

To configure The Lounge, go to
[the configuration section](/docs/configuration.html).

You might want to serve The Lounge behind a reverse proxy such as Nginx. To know
more about the benefits and steps, follow
[the guide on reverse proxies](/docs/guides/reverse-proxies.html).

## From npm releases

Installing the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/thelounge) directly
allows you to use stable releases on systems where we do not provide native
packages.

First, make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v6.13.0 or more recent is installed
with `node --version`, as well as [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). If not, follow
the instructions given on the
[official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) by
choosing your distribution in the list.

{: .alert.alert-info role="alert"}
If you are not able to install yarn and need to use [npm](https://npmjs.com), be sure to add the `--unsafe-perm` flag when running `npm install --global --unsafe-perm thelounge`.

Then install The Lounge using:

```sh
yarn global add thelounge
```

{: .alert.alert-info role="alert"}
Note that installing from npm does not daemonize nor autostart The Lounge.

Start the server manually using:

```sh
thelounge start
```

{: .alert.alert-info role="alert"}
If `thelounge` is not found by your shell, you will need to add the output of `yarn global bin` to your PATH.

The Lounge is now up and running **in private mode** at <http://localhost:9000>.

Read more about how to use The Lounge from the command line in
[the CLI usage section](/docs/usage.html).

Its configuration file is located at `~/.thelounge/config.js`. To configure The
Lounge, go to [the configuration section](/docs/configuration.html).

To upgrade The Lounge, simply re-run the `install` command above, and restart it.

You might want to serve The Lounge behind a reverse proxy such as Nginx. To know
more about the benefits and steps, follow
[the guide on reverse proxies ](/docs/guides/reverse-proxies.html).

## Docker

Official Docker images of The Lounge are made available for every new release on
[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/thelounge/lounge/).

To run a container using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/),
use [this example `docker-compose.yml`
file](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)
and run:

```
docker-compose up --detach
```

Otherwise, run:

```
docker run --detach \
	--name thelounge \
	--publish 9000:9000 \
	--volume ~/.thelounge:/home/thelounge/data \
	--restart always \
	thelounge/thelounge:latest
```

[the official repository](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge-docker).

## Running from source

Running The Lounge from source ensures you are running the most recent codebase.

{: .alert.alert-warning role="alert"}
While running The Lounge from source allows you to test the latest features, it
may be unstable or insecure. This is not production-ready, so use at your own
risk!<br>
It is also not recommended to run this as a `root` user.

First, make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v6.13.0 or more recent is installed
with `node --version`, as well as [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com). If not, follow the instructions given on the
[official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) by
choosing your distribution in the list.

The following commands install the development version of The Lounge:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge
cd thelounge
yarn install
NODE_ENV=production yarn build
yarn link
```

{: .alert.alert-info role="alert"}
Note that installing from source does not daemonize nor autostart The Lounge.

Start the server manually using:

```sh
thelounge start
```

{: .alert.alert-info role="alert"}
`yarn link` adds a symlink to the source version of thelounge into yarn's global bin directory. You will need to add the output of `yarn global bin` to your PATH.

The Lounge is now up and running **in private mode** at <http://localhost:9000>.

Read more about how to use The Lounge from the command line in
[the CLI usage section](/docs/usage.html).

Its configuration file is located at `~/.thelounge/config.js`. To configure The
Lounge, go to [the configuration section](/docs/configuration.html).

To upgrade The Lounge, simply `git pull` the repository, re-run the `install` and
`build` commands above, and restart it.

You might want to serve The Lounge behind a reverse proxy such as Nginx. To know
more about the benefits and steps, follow
[the guide on reverse proxies ](/docs/guides/reverse-proxies.html).
