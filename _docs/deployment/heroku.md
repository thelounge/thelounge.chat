# Heroku

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  <strong>As of February 2017, this document is deprecated. It will not be maintained anymore and will soon be removed.</strong>

This document will explain how to install The Lounge on Heroku. If you want to learn about Heroku you should read their [documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction).

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  <p>
    Please be aware that Heroku automatically kills unpaid apps after 1 hour of inactivity, and then spins them back up the next time a request comes in.
    This does not apply to paid accounts.
    If you scale up to two servers and pay for the second one, you get two always-on servers.

  </p>

  <p>
    When Heroku kills The Lounge, you need to connect to servers and channels again from scratch.
    In practice, you get no always-on functionality with an unpaid Heroku account.
  </p>
</div>

### Step 1:

Begin by logging in with the [Heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/):

    heroku login

### Step 2:

Clone the repository and install The Lounge from source:

    git clone https://github.com/thelounge/lounge
    cd lounge
    npm install
    NODE_ENV=production npm run build

### Step 3:

In the `lounge/` directory, run:

    heroku create

### Step 4: (optional)

_This step is only useful if you want to run The Lounge with users accounts._

Create a `Procfile` and edit the content to look like this:

    web: node index --private --home /app

_You can read more about Procfiles [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile)._

To create users, run the following in the `lounge/` directory:

    ./index.js --home . add <username>

### Step 5:

Time to publish to Heroku!

If you've made any changes to the repository (like adding users or the Profile), don't forget to save the changes with `git`:

    git add .
    git commit -m "Added Heroku files"

And with that done, lets go ahead and push to Heroku:

    git push heroku
