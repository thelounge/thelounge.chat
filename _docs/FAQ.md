## Why the fork?

We felt that the original [Shout](https://github.com/erming/shout) project
"stagnated" a little because its original author wanted it to remain his pet
project (which is a perfectly fine thing!).

A bunch of people, excited about making things a bit differently than the upstream
project forked it under a new name: «The Lounge».

This forks aims to be community managed, meaning that the decisions are taken
in a collegial fashion, and that a bunch of maintainers should be able to make
the review process more streamlined.
